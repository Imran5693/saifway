## Project Overview
The **Digital Certificate Management Portal** is a **Python Flask web application** designed to streamline the **lifecycle of digital certificates** in enterprise environments.  
It integrates with **Step CA**, supports **ACME-based automation**, and connects to an **LDAP server** for authentication and authorization. The portal provides a centralized interface for **issuing, revoking, renewing, and monitoring certificates**, and includes REST APIs for integration with external systems.

The project demonstrates hands-on expertise in **DevOps, cloud security, identity management, and web automation**, combining **Python scripting, Ubuntu server management, and modern web development practices**.

### Functional Features

#### User Roles & Access Control
- **Admin**: Full control over certificates, users, and system configuration.  
- **Certificate Manager**: Issue, revoke, renew certificates; deploy certificates on servers using SSH.  
- **Regular User**: Request and view personal certificates.  

#### Certificate Management
- Generate **Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)**.  
- Issue **new certificates** based on CSRs.  
- Revoke certificates before expiration.  
- Renew **expiring certificates** automatically.  
- Support **self-signed** and **CA-signed certificates**.  

#### Authentication & Security
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authentication.  
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for secure access.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for user permissions.  
- LDAP / Active Directory integration for centralized authentication.  

#### Logging & Monitoring
- Maintain detailed **audit logs** of certificate activities.  
- Alerts and notifications for certificate expiry or revocation.  
- Exportable logs for compliance audits.  

#### API & Integration
- REST API for managing certificates programmatically.  
- ACME protocol support for automated certificate issuance.  
- Webhooks to notify external systems of certificate events.  

#### User Interface
- Dashboard displaying certificate status, expiry dates, and usage metrics.  
- Search, filter, and graphical representation of certificates.  
- Modern **responsive design** compatible with desktop and mobile devices.
