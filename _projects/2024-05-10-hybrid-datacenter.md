## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a hybrid network architecture** to support outsourced data center backup operations. The network ensures **secure communication**, **high availability**, and **optimized performance** through QoS and segmentation policies.

The proposed design integrates:
- **Backup Server** – Deployed within the organization's on-premises data center to manage backup operations.
- **Storage Devices** – Network Attached Storage (NAS) or SAN-based storage systems for local backup storage.
- **Network Infrastructure** – High-bandwidth, segmented network with QoS for prioritizing backup traffic.

## Case Study: Hybrid Network Backup Design
**Problem:**  
Organizations require secure and reliable backup connectivity between on-premises infrastructure and cloud data centers.

**Solution:**  
Implemented a hybrid network design using OSPF routing, VPN GRE tunnels, ACL-based security, and QoS policies to protect and prioritize backup traffic.

**Result:**  
A secure, scalable backup network topology with high availability, optimized performance, and centralized monitoring.

---

## Project Scope
The network is designed to guarantee the **security, integrity, and reliability** of communication between:
- **On-Premises Data Center** (Core Server, Monitoring Server, Backup Server)
- **Two Remote Sites** – Connected via serial links with high availability enabled between them.
- **Cloud Data Center** – Integrated using secure **VPN GRE tunnels**.
- **OSPF Routing** – For dynamic, efficient path selection.
- **ACL Security** – To filter and protect network traffic.
- **QoS** – To optimize bandwidth usage and prioritize critical backup traffic.

---

## Network Design Lab Overview
This project can also be treated as a **network design lab**, where OSPF routing, VPN GRE tunneling, ACL security, and QoS policies were validated using simulated environments. The lab tested routing convergence, tunnel stability, and secure backup traffic flow.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a **comprehensive hybrid architecture** aligned with organizational security requirements.
- Clearly define the number and roles of routers and switches in the design.
- Assess the **existing network infrastructure** for compatibility and connectivity.
- Identify **vulnerabilities** and potential security weaknesses.
- Enable **real-time monitoring and logging** for proactive threat detection.
- Provide **comprehensive documentation** and training for IT staff.

---

## Requirements Delivered
- **Topology Diagram** (Visio-based, professional format)
- **Test Cases** ensuring reliable communication
- **Configuration Commands** for:
  - OSPF Routing
  - VPN GRE setup
  - ACLs for access control
  - QoS for traffic optimization
- Security gap analysis and integration with existing infrastructure

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Latest Version)
- **Microsoft Visio** (Topology Design)
- Networking protocols: **OSPF, VPN GRE**
- Security controls: **ACLs, QoS**

---

## Outcome
The implemented hybrid network provides:
- **Reliable inter-site connectivity** with high availability
- **Secure cloud integration** for outsourced backup services
- **Optimized traffic flow** for backup operations
- **Real-time monitoring capability**
- A **scalable and secure foundation** for future expansions
