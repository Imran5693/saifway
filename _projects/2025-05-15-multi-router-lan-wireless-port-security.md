## Project Overview
The **Multi-Router LAN with Wireless Integration and Port Security Simulation** is a **Cisco Packet Tracer project** that models a secure enterprise network.  
It demonstrates **LAN segmentation, multi-router configuration, wired and wireless connectivity, and network access control**. Unauthorized or rogue devices are blocked using **port security and MAC filtering**, while legitimate users maintain seamless access.

The simulation emphasizes **OSI and TCP/IP model alignment**, **RIP routing**, and practical network security strategies applied to multi-department networks.
