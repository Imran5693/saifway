## Project Overview
The **Identity Management User Interface (IDMUI)** is a **Flask-based web application** that automates the management of **OpenStack Keystone services** and provides a **centralized interface** for administrators and users. Designed for **real-time control and monitoring**, it integrates **Ubuntu server automation, REST APIs, and network automation** to streamline identity and access management tasks in cloud environments.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in **DevOps practices, API-driven automation, and cloud service management** by combining **Python scripting, OpenStack Keystone APIs, and Docker-based deployment**.

---

### Key Features
- **OpenStack Keystone Integration**: Secure login system using Keystone authentication and token-based validation.  
- **User, Role & Project Management**: Full CRUD operations on users, roles, and projects via the web interface.  
- **Service Automation**: Start, stop, and configure Keystone services remotely using **Paramiko and Python automation scripts**.  
- **API-Driven Operations**: Leverage REST APIs to integrate OpenStack services with the IDMUI platform.  
- **Database Management**: Real-time MySQL integration for backend storage, service configurations, and logs.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admins and users have differentiated access and menus.  
- **Modern & Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly interface with sidebar navigation, flash messaging, and real-time notifications.  
- **Reporting & Documentation**: Generate structured PDF reports of users, roles, projects, and service status using **ReportLab**.  
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized for **easy deployment, scalability, and reproducibility**.  

---

### Tools & Technologies
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), Paramiko  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- **APIs**: OpenStack Keystone REST API  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **Servers**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
- **Other**: PDF generation (ReportLab), Real-time Web Notifications

### Outcome
The IDMUI project successfully achieved:
- **Centralized control of Keystone services**, reducing administrative complexity.  
- **Automated user, role, and project management**, saving manual effort.  
- **Integration of Ubuntu server tasks and network automation** through API and SSH scripting.  
- **Improved DevOps practices** with containerized deployment and REST API integration.  
- **Enhanced user experience** via a modern, responsive web interface.  
- **Professional-grade reporting** and real-time monitoring for operational efficiency.  

This project showcases **expertise in Python automation, cloud IAM solutions, API integration, and web-based system administration**, making it a high-value portfolio piece for **DevOps, cloud engineering, and IT automation roles**.
