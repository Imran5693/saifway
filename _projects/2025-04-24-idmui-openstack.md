## Project Overview

**IDMUI (Identity Management User Interface)** is a custom-built, **Python Flask-based IAM web application** developed by **Imran Sarwar (Saif Way Technology)** to simplify and centralize **OpenStack Keystone identity management**.

The platform provides a **single, user-friendly web interface** for managing **users, roles, projects, and Keystone services** through secure authentication and **REST API-driven automation**.

Designed for **cloud and DevOps environments**, IDMUI improves administrative efficiency, security, and visibility for Identity and Access Management (IAM) operations.

---

## What is IDMUI?

IDMUI acts as a **bridge between administrators and OpenStack Keystone**, abstracting complex CLI and API operations into a **secure, role-based web dashboard**.

It enables organizations to:
- Centrally manage identities
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
- Monitor Keystone services
- Automate IAM tasks using APIs

---

## Key Features

- **OpenStack Keystone Integration**  
  Secure authentication using Keystone tokens and role-based authorization.

- **User, Role & Project Management**  
  Full CRUD operations for users, roles, and projects via a centralized interface.

- **Centralized IAM Dashboard**  
  Real-time visibility into identity resources and access assignments.

- **REST API Automation**  
  All operations are executed using OpenStack Keystone REST APIs.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Admin and standard user views with restricted access controls.

- **Service Monitoring & Control**  
  View Keystone service status and perform administrative actions securely.

- **Database Integration**  
  MySQL-backed storage for configuration data, logs, and metadata.

- **Modern Responsive UI**  
  Clean, mobile-friendly interface built with Bootstrap and JavaScript.

- **Containerized Deployment**  
  Docker-based setup for portability, scalability, and reproducibility.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- **Identity Platform**: OpenStack Keystone  
- **APIs**: REST API  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **Server OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  

---

## Outcome

The IDMUI project successfully delivered:

- A **centralized IAM web interface** for OpenStack Keystone
- Simplified **user, role, and project management**
- Secure **RBAC-based access control**
- Reduced dependency on CLI-based administration
- Improved **operational efficiency** and visibility
- A **production-ready IAM portfolio project**

This project demonstrates strong capabilities in **cloud IAM, API integration, Flask web development, and DevOps-oriented system design**, making it a high-value showcase for **cloud, DevOps, and security engineering roles**.
