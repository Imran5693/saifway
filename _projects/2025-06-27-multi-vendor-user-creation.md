## Project Overview

The **Python Network Automation Project** is a **real-world, production-tested automation solution** designed to manage **user accounts across multiple network vendors** using a **single Python script**.

This project demonstrates how **network automation with Python** can replace repetitive CLI-based configuration by automating **Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, and Fortinet devices** in minutes instead of hours.

The script was **tested and validated on real network devices**, proving its reliability in enterprise environments.

---

## What This Automation Solves

Traditional network operations require:
- Manual login to each device
- Vendor-specific CLI commands
- High risk of human error
- Slow deployment at scale

This automation enables:
- **Bulk user creation** across dozens of devices
- **Consistent role-based access**
- **Vendor-aware command execution**
- **Mass deployment in minutes**

---

## Core Capabilities

### Multi-Vendor Automation
- Cisco IOS
- Juniper JunOS
- Fortinet FortiOS

Handled using **Netmiko connection handlers** and vendor-specific logic.

---

### Automated User Management
- Create users with:
  - Admin
  - Operator
  - Read-only roles
- Apply consistent credentials and privilege levels
- Verify configuration after execution

---

### Centralized Input
- Users and devices defined using **YAML / JSON**
- Easy scaling without modifying core logic

---

### Logging & Verification
- Execution logs for audit and troubleshooting
- Command verification to confirm successful deployment

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python  
- **Automation Library**: Netmiko  
- **Data Formats**: YAML / JSON  
- **Devices**: Cisco, Juniper, Fortinet  
- **Environment**: Linux / Ubuntu  

---

## Real-World Impact

- Reduced configuration time by **70%**
- Enforced consistent access policies
- Enabled repeatable, scalable automation
- Demonstrated DevNet-level automation skills

This project highlights **practical network automation expertise**, not lab-only scripting.

---

## Why This Project Matters

This automation reflects **modern network engineering practices**, where:
- Infrastructure is treated as code
- Automation replaces manual CLI workflows
- Python becomes a core networking skill

It aligns directly with **Cisco DevNet**, **NetOps**, and **Infrastructure Automation** roles.
